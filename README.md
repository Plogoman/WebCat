## üöÄ Usage

### Basic Command

```bash
webcat server
```

This starts the server on `http://0.0.0.0:8000` serving the current directory.

### Command Options

```

  -p, --port INTEGER        Port to listen on [default: 8000]
  -d, --directory TEXT      Directory to serve [default: .]
  -b, --bind TEXT           IP address to bind to [default: 0.0.0.0]
  -h, --help                Show this message and exit
  -v, --version             Show version information
```

### Examples

**Start server on custom port:**
```bash
webcat server --port 9000
```

**Serve a specific directory:**
```bash

```

**Bind to localhost only:**
```bash
webcat server --bind 127.0.0.1
```

**Complete custom configuration:**

```

**Check version:**
```bash
webcat --version
```
